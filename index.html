  <h1>Cities I've Lived</h1>
    <p>I was born in a NJ hospital but lived in Manhattan as a baby.
      When I was younger, I lived in VA and AL for about 2 years but don't
      remember which cities/towns. After that, I lived in Queens again for a
      little and then back to NJ for most of my life. I went to Montclair
      University in NJ and then transferred to Rutgers. I just moved to Denver
      in April.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manhattan, NY</li>

    </ul>
  <h1>Cities I Want to Visit</h1>
    <p>I love the west coast and have been several times but never got to
      visit the cities below yet. I like the aspect of national parks/beautiful
      outdoor scenery in combination with a city -- and I heard that Lake Tahoe
      is amazing.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Seattle, WA<span>&#43</span></strong></li>
      <li><em>Portland, OR<span>&#43</span></em></li>
      <li><strong>Lake Tahoe, CA<span>&#43</span></strong></li>
    </ol>
